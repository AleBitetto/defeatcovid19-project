#How different competencies could help fighting COVID19

We need support from everyone that is willing to contribute to this fight, which will probably last for months and affect many people worldwide. How you can support the group depends on who you are. If you are:

- a **doctor in the frontline**: we know that it's not the best time to ask for time, but a considerable part of this work will require building an image dataset from RX and/or ultrasound of healthy lungs and with pneumonia (better if covid19 induced interstitial pneumonia). If you could just dedicate a few times helping us to reach as many images as possible, it could help a lot having results in no time. Please signup or reach out directly at support@defeatcovid19.org.

- a **doctor or medical personnel**: we still need your support, we're writing inquiries for ethical committees and building a contact list to ask for contributions. Someone with medical (or clinical) expertise could help to coordinate all these efforts.

- a **data scientist**, you could join the group, share the results you've already achieved (if any) or join a new exploration track. We started focusing on medical imaging, but we're not bounded to it, the only constraint is the amount of effort we can put on a given track. Do you want to contribute to an already existing track? do you want to start a new one and share data and results? Jump in!

- a **technology company**, you could provide supporting technology for group participants. Having a wide set of tools is fundamental to achieve results and since we're basically contributing for free to support the fight, having support would be great. Plus we're open sourcing all the results and datasets. If you want to do more, you could offer employee time to work on this project. 

- a **developer**, you could provide all the framework needed to reach more and more people. We have many side systems (account setup, website, DevOps, etc.) that we'll have to address anytime soon. Join us and we'll see

- a **communication/marketing/media specialist**, you could help us spreading the word. We need to reach out the highest number of people to onboard them and share the results.

- just **interested**: subscribe to the website, we'll keep you posted as soon as there is something new and maybe you'll find anything where you can help
